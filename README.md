# terriajs-dive
A place to raise and discuss issues surrounding the 2016 CDI Proposal ["Evaluating a new opensource, standards-based framework for web portal development in the geosciences"](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56d87a7de4b015c306f6cfcf). Here is a [nicely-rendered version of the FY16 Final Report](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/issues/12)

We use [Github issues](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/issues) instead of e-mail discussion, as they are more effective for technical conversations, and they capture project-related correspondence in one place.   

Check out the TerriaJS Tips and Links on the [project wiki](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/wiki)

### GPX Track on 3D Terrian
GPX track from a hike uploaded to github and then added via "Add Data=>Add Web Data":

Note: On mobile devices, try clicking on "Map=>3D Terrain" and using two-finger gestures to manipulate the 3D view!

This URL was created by hitting the "Share" button, which saved the configuration (including 3D view) as JSON in a Gist. The gist can be viewed using https://gist.github.com/rsignell-usgs/0ce1a319a714784bd0aa47671021d676
