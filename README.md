# terriajs-dive
A place to raise and discuss issues surrounding the 2016 CDI Proposal ["Evaluating a new opensource, standards-based framework for web portal development in the geosciences"](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56d87a7de4b015c306f6cfcf). Here is a [nicely-rendered version of the FY16 Final Report](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/issues/12)

We use [Github issues](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/issues) instead of e-mail discussion, as they are more effective for technical conversations, and they capture project-related correspondence in one place.   

Check out the TerriaJS Tips and Links on the [project wiki](https://github.com/USGS-CMG/terriajs-dive/wiki)
